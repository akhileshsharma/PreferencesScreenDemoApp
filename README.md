## Introduction
- Preferences are pieces of information that Apps store persistently(in a file or storage) and then use them to configure itself. 
- Apps often expose preferences to users using "Prefrence Screen" so that they can customize the appearance and behavior of the app. 
- So "Preferences Screen" is screen that exposes the preferences to user and also let them alter the value of these preferences.
- Preference Screen is backed by a Shared preference file that stores preference values persistently.
- Android system creates a default shared preference file for each app.
- Android also provide developer with option to create a new shared preference file and use that instead of default shared preference file.
